*SUMMARY:

Billy Jones was on-schedule during 100% (13/13) of losses at the Roulette Table on 3/10, 3/12 & 3/15. 


*METHOD:

From the Roulette_Losses file I created, we knew the dates and times of all losses. Now, we just
had to determine who was working the Roulette Tables. After previewing the *Dealer_schedule files,
I realized that the schedules were formatted by the hour in rows, and by game type in columns. In order 
to narrow down the results to dates/times of reported losses and narrow down the results to only
include Roulette dealers, I created a script that used the following sequence (see:
Dealer_Investigation.sh for more detail):

grep '05:00:00 AM' 0310_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1,$2,$5,$6}' > Dealers_working_during_losses
grep '08:00:00 AM' 0310_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1,$2,$5,$6}' >> Dealers_working_during_losses
...
grep '02:00:00 PM' 0315_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1,$2,$5,$6}' >> Dealers_working_during_losses

When I ran it (sh Dealer_Lookup.sh), the script searched each day's file for lines including the times in
question, printed them, narrowed down the results to only include date, time and dealer's first/last name
columns, then redirected the data to a new file (appending after its creation in the first line). The
results generated Billy Jones on-schedule for each of the reported losses. A quick "wc -l" command on the
Dealers_working_during_losses file confirmed that all 13 incidents were listed.
